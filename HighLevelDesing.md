## Frameworks and Programming Languages
### Django - Backend Development
The system logic and backend development will be implemented on the Django Framework. Django is a python based web development framework designed to help web developers develop their applications as smoothly as possible by providing the base requirements need for a web app. This framework provides simpler implementation of views, templates, and databases. Django provides compatibility with several different types of databases. This allows web developers to be able to choose based on their own abilities and what individual projects require. Django also provides API abilities which allows for easier integration with other frameworks and programs.

The design of the Django framework is ideal for the Drone Cones backend system for the following reasons:
* Choose a database (MySQL) that is easy to work with and effectively stores necessary data
* Use a high level language that provides smooth transitioning from design to implementation
* Use relevant and well known framework and language that will be easier to train new people on as the application grows
* Use API capabilities to connect with front end framework for smooth communication of information between the server and the user
