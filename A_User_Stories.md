# Customer

As a customer, I want to be able to:

- Easily order icecream so that I can get the icecream I want.
- See my past orders, so I can get something I liked from before.
- Contact the managers, so that I can complain about things I don't like.
- Track my order, so I can see how long I have to wait before enjoying my icecream.

# Manager

- See inventory, so I can see if I need order more supplies when it get low.
- Update inventory, so that the inventory is correct with what I have.
- See pending orders, so I can see how my business is doing.
- See completed orders, so I can see what is the hot thing currently.
- See finainces, so I can see how much money I'm making or losing.

# Droney

As a droney, I want to be able to:

- Allow DroneCones to use my drone to have a small and consistent revenue stream.
- Deactivate my drone on DroneCones so that I can use my drone for personal reasons.
- See a list of the drones I have registered with DroneCone and their details so I can know where my drones are and what they are doing.
